## **My Experience Learning LXD Containers from a YouTube Video**

Recently, I spent some time exploring the realm of containerization and stumbled upon a fantastic video that deepened my understanding of LXD Containers. I found this resource on YouTube, and for those interested, here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIwgPKkVj8s) to the video.

### **Key Takeaways from the Video:**

1. **Introduction to LXD**:
   
   I was introduced to LXD (pronounced "lex-dee"), which is an advanced container manager developed by Canonical. What intrigued me most is how LXD offers an experience similar to VMs but retains the nimbleness of containers.

3. **Installing LXD and Setting Up the Profile**:

   Installation: ``sudo apt install lxd``

   Initialize LXD: ``lxd init``

   For easy access: ``sudo usermod -aG lxd $USER``

3. **Launching Containers**:

   To launch a Debian container: ``lxc launch images:debian/10 debian-container``

   Checking active containers: ``lxc list``

4. **Working with the Containers**:

   To view the contents of a file within a container (like checking OS details): ``lxc exec debian-container -- cat /etc/os-release``

5. **Managing Containers**:

   Stopping a container: ``lxc stop [container-name]``

   Starting a container: ``lxc start [container-name]``

   Restarting a container: This was inferred, but the general syntax is likely ``lxc restart [container-name]``.

6. **Deleting a container**:
   
   First, stop it: ``lxc stop [container-name]``

   Then delete: ``lxc delete [container-name]``

7. **Using Snapshots**:

   Creating a snapshot: ``lxc snapshot [container-name] mysnap1``

   Viewing snapshot info: ``lxc info [container-name]``

   Deleting a snapshot: ``lxc delete [container-name] mysnap1``

   Restoring a snapshot: ``lxc restore [container-name] mysnap1``

8. **Configuring Containers**:

   Setting a container to autostart: ``lxc config set [container-name] boot.autostart 1``

   Limiting a container's memory usage: ``lxc config set [container-name] limits.memory 1GB``

   Viewing a containerâ€™s configuration: ``lxc config show [container-name]``

   Setting a startup delay: ``lxc config set [container-name] boot.autostart.delay 30``

   Specifying the order in which containers start: ``lxc config set [container-name] boot.autostart.priority 8``

### **Final Thoughts:**

After watching this video, I genuinely feel more confident about diving into the world of LXD. The easy-to-follow instructions, combined with in-depth demonstrations, made for a rewarding learning experience. For anyone keen on getting hands-on with LXD, I'd highly recommend giving this video a watch. The comprehensive coverage of LXD's features, from basic container management to advanced storage and networking, is indeed invaluable.
